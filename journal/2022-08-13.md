# 2022-08-13

Today the new [#js13kgames][js13kgames] competition launched.

Like last year, I found time to participate on the [kick-off event][kickoff]
over Zoom. I expect the [recording][youtube] to show up on YouTube later.

It basically was about presenting three libraries / frameworks you can build
a game in: Kontra, Little.js and Goodluck.

They had interesting ideas, but were too pixelgraphics-focussed for what I am
going after (again, a SVG entry). Interesting questions were about 3D support
and TypeScript. There are people who don't want to have a build step (myself
included).

Looking at the timeframe, it intersects with our holidays (as always).
I hope to get a playable game before we move off.

Looking at the extra categories: WebXR made my fan spin just by visiting the
website. So I assume, it will be quite challenging to develop a 3D game using
any of the provided libraries (A-Frame, Three.js, Babylon.js or PlayCanvas).
WebMonetization with Coil expects credit cards, so no dice for me.
Decentralised is a misnamer for Web3 here, so nope. I haven't decided on
whether I want to opt into the server entry, though. I prepare for it, because
it is not much extra code to add. I can look at previous entries and there is
less competition.

## Today's achievement

I set up my boilerplate repo:

[commit diff ac1939fb0635361b6b5fae3f83273f82e278480b to 27c71f0aba56180d421a7d56aa87619bdf58a87e][diff]

### Setup

This year's topic is _DEATH_. So I have some ideas, but haven't checked the
usual places yet, as I am at home with three kids, which demand some level of
attention. The idea that sticks the most in my head right now is:

- Planet Earth. How many ways you can come up with killing it off?
- [Golgari Swarm][golgari]: Considering Death as part of Life and engaging in
  necromancy.
- Bored to death: Something like [clickclickclick.click][click] but opposite
- Death Metal: A rhythm game?
- Reaper Man from Discworld: Death is nowhere to be found. What are the effects?
- Four horsemen of the apocalypse?

Some of these ideas lean towards 3D games which I won't develop.

## Next steps

I moved off of Twitter, so if you want to follow along, you will need to sign
up with Mastodon. I'm on layer8.space and will use the js13kgames hashtag.

I also want to give up on GitHub as much as possible. I might use
Codeberg Pages for hosting next to my own domain.

### Codewise

- [ ] Pick a name and adjust `single.html` and `rollup.config.js`.
