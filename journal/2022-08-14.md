I had some time with family today. Ideal to let the mind wander.
Got various new ideas throughout the day.

For example, death plays an important part in video games, such as:

- Undertale
- Final Fantasy XIII
- Curse of Monkey Island

Or with tarot cards (here: monkey island poker cards).

I pondered different options as well. I was thinking about some flipping
between life and death. I remember someone submitting an entry, where you
had that once you used a door. Nice.

Or some kind of life simulation. But I would like to have death to have some
meaning. Heroic death? Hm, quite vague.

A third idea was to experiment with spatial audio in a horror game.

Or playing as necromancer always on the lookout to find new minions â€¦

In the end I settled on a Tower Defence game. Using a black and white colour
palette and picking a side. Somewhat inspired by [Anuto TD][anuto].

## Today's achievement

I already have some visuals!

## Next steps

I would like to have some word art for the title. I already have something in
mind but will need to check, whether it works across devices.

### Codewise

- [ ] Implement side choice
- [ ] Allow to place towers
- [ ] Have some kind of control over time to spawn enemies
