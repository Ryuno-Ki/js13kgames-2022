Woo! I was busy today.

Yesterday I felt I was get a bit stuck with creating levels.
So today's focus was on writing a level editor while also doing some research
on how to track the position of the text.

I figured, that by placing each enemy (for lack of better term) on a different
`<text>` I could better handle their death.

However, I either have to manually set the `startOffset` attribute of
`<animate>` or even move the `<text>` nodes around myself (`x` and `y`).
Either way I will need to determine the position (e.g. adding the line segments
length and then determine the position based on the percentage assuming linear
accelleration).

I also thought about adding `<circle>`s below the `<text>` node to act as
field of view. Then I can use circle collision detection for damage calculation.

Anuto is listing different stats per enemy, so that might be something to
implement later as well. For now, every enemy will have a single life and need
to be lucky to slip through the check intervalls of the defenders.

## Today's achievement

Another kilobyte. I haven't taken care of optimisation, though.

## Next steps

I will need to look into placing the defenders and collision detection soon.
That might also help with determining win and loose conditions.

### Codewise

- [ ] Allow to place defenders
- [ ] Add win condition
- [ ] Add loose condition
- [ ] Deploy on Codeberg Pages
