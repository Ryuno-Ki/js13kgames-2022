What a bummer. I was so much on the road today, that I could not develop much.
Instead, I picked up some chores to make sure, that HTML and CSS are part of
the build process as well.

## Today's achievement

[commit diff 6c48b0989a67b2da41c60f7dd5cb02c581f86932 to 7607d32e20246b0ef4941c7ef0b392a9f4b9a01c][diff]

Wow, I saved some bytes!

## Next steps

Same as yesterday.

### Codewise

- [ ] Define a structure to map line segments to start timepoint in percentage
  so the position can be faster determined.
- [ ] Swap positions dynamically for begin and end emoji
- [ ] Explain that the choice of party will result in attack and defending
  scenarios
- [ ] Save a draftLevel to the regular ones
