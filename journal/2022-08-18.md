# 2022-08-18

I only managed to get some coding in the evening. I don't feel all that well,
but I need to get these ideas out of my head, so I can focus on the gaps I
discover while implementing.

Did you know, that [DEATH][abbreviation] can be an abbreviation for a lot of
weird things?

I guess I don't have to point to metal bands such as
[<abbr title="5 Fingers Death Punch">5FDP</abbr>][ffdp], do I?

## Today's achievement

[commit diff 7ef6688dc5eaf900e57683f34f85c34b3e35b386 to 2392abbd572993941e683aa67dafa1449139b99e][diff]

## Next steps

Tomorrow is likely going to be the only day left before my vacation, when I can
get focus time. I should squeeze at least enough code into it, that I can work
offline using Termux and Markor on Android.

### Codewise

- [x] Deploy on Codeberg Pages
- [x] Pick towers like enemies
- [ ] Animate along the whole pathway
- [x] Show circles beneath the enemies and towers as field of view
  (Towers might even have a pulse to show some downtime, so enemies can slip?)
- [x] Implement circle collision
- [ ] Implement lives (even if I start with only 1 for player and enemies)
- [ ] Show life bar (using spades?)
- [ ] Look at https://xem.github.io/unicode13/emoji.html for ensuring Emoji support
- [x] Spice up title with animation (opacity, fading in using delays) and orientation
