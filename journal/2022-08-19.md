# 2022-08-19

Today was a busy day. Easily my last chance to get code in before I have to
resort to mobile.

But I also achived **a lot**. I'm happy.

## Today's achievement

[commit diff 872d09cee7260c8d48ef56009a927767f3565046 to 32efd0b86e790606ce22c917e76f880e6d5fee14][diff]

## Next steps

I will need collision detection and the computation of lives to finalise the
playable game state. The state is getting a bit overwhelming, so restructuring
might be worth the time, too.

### Codewise

- [ ] Level as JSON
- [ ] Enemy as JSON
- [ ] Enemy / Tower description
- [x] License text in About scene
- [x] Prefers reduced motion also as setting
- [ ] zzFxm sounds (with setting)
- [ ] background music (with setting)
- [ ] rollup to rename single.html to index.html
- [ ] inlining of CSS and JS
