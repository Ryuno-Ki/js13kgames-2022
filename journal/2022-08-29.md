I walked over the previous journal entries and updated them.

Plus, I refactored the logic for determining attack or defense position into
its own function because I will need to reuse it.

## Today's achievement

Nothing to see here.

## Next steps

Refactor the win check to look at lives respectively enemies length.

### Codewise

- [ ] Set player life in defense position to 1 and attack position to the
  number of enemies with life greater than 0
- [ ] Refactor win check to have at least one enemy hit home in attack position
  and all enemies with 0 life in defense one.
- [ ] Implement a check of circle collision between towers and enemies
