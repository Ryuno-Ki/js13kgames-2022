I need to find my groove again. So I spent some time adding tests and going
through previous next steps. They still need to be ticked off.
I fixed some broken links.

What bothers me most is that there is some bug with my win condition checks.
Guess that's where I should focus my time next.

I learned quite a bit about import type assertions and configuring Rollup and
TypeScript for it today.

## Today's achievement

Will be shown soon.

## Next steps

Add more tests to get on top of the complexity.

### Codewise

- [ ] Understand win condition check bug
- [ ] Get rid of FIXME comments
- [ ] Add documentation explaining the architecture
- [ ] Add size statements, diff links and screenshots to journal
